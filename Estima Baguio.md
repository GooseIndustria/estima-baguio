# Estima Baguio  
**Local Construction Pricing & Estimation Infrastructure**

---

## 1. Why Estima Baguio Exists

Construction pricing in Baguio is structurally different from pricing in the lowlands.

Transport costs, terrain, weather, fragmented supply chains, and informal vendor practices create price behavior that cannot be accurately inferred from Manila or nearby cities. Yet most estimates are still made using:
- Generic spreadsheets
- Outdated reference prices
- Assumptions copied from lowland benchmarks

This results in:
- Inflated contingency buffers
- Client mistrust when numbers feel arbitrary
- Contractors absorbing losses when real prices exceed estimates

**Estima Baguio exists to ground construction estimates in local reality.**

Not in averages.
Not in national standards.
But in what materials actually cost in Baguio, today.

---

## 2. The Long-Term Vision

Estima Baguio is envisioned as **local construction infrastructure**, not merely an app.

In its fully realized form, Estima Baguio will:
- Understand rough sketches and floor plans
- Translate drawings into material requirements
- Reference live, Baguio-specific price intelligence
- Connect estimates directly to local hardware suppliers
- Enable ordering, payment, and delivery tracking

The end-state is a system where:
> A contractor can go from idea → estimate → materials → delivery  
> without leaving the local ecosystem.

This vision acknowledges that **construction is physical, local, and logistical** — not abstract or global.

---

## 3. Reality Check

That full vision is complex.

It requires:
- Vendor participation
- Reliable pricing data
- Trust from contractors
- Logistics coordination
- Payment handling
- Careful introduction of AI-assisted analysis

Attempting to build this all at once would:
- Increase failure risk
- Destroy user trust if accuracy is poor
- Shift focus from the core problem

Therefore, the project must start smaller.

---

## 4. The Strategic Wedge

The true foundation of Estima Baguio is **pricing intelligence**.

Before automation.
Before computer vision.
Before ordering and payments.

The system must first answer one question reliably:

> “What does this actually cost in Baguio?”

If that question is answered well, everything else becomes possible.

If it is answered poorly, nothing else matters.

## 5. The MVP (What We Build First)

### MVP Definition

The MVP is a **mobile-first Baguio construction estimation tool** that replaces spreadsheets by anchoring estimates to local price realities.

No AI magic.
No automated ordering.
No vendor lock-in.

Just accurate, transparent pricing.

---

### MVP Capabilities

The MVP will allow a user to:

- Manually list construction materials
- Input quantities
- View Baguio-calibrated price ranges
- Select a preferred local hardware reference
- Instantly compute totals based on local pricing

Prices are:
- Grounded in real hardware data
- Updated manually or periodically
- Transparent in origin and timestamp

The output is:
- A defensible estimate
- Suitable for client discussion
- Rooted in local context

---

### What the MVP Explicitly Does *Not* Do

The MVP will **not**:
- Read drawings or floor plans
- Automatically infer materials
- Process payments
- Place orders
- Track deliveries
- Promise real-time pricing

These features are future layers, not foundations.

---

## 6. Why This MVP Matters

This MVP:
- Solves a real problem today
- Requires no behavior change from contractors
- Builds trust through accuracy, not novelty
- Creates the data backbone for future expansion

It also functions as:
- An internal estimation tool
- A shared reference for local pricing norms
- A proof that local-first software can outperform generic tools

---

## 7. Path Forward

Once the MVP is:
- Used in real projects
- Trusted by contractors
- Calibrated over time

Then and only then can Estima Baguio evolve into:
- Assisted estimation via images
- Vendor visibility and comparisons
- Transaction and logistics layers

Each step must be earned through demonstrated reliability.

---

## 8. Design Philosophy

- Local first
- Accuracy over automation
- Transparency over abstraction
- Trust before scale

Estima Baguio is not trying to be clever.

It is trying to be **correct**.

## 9. Working Principle

> Build the local truth first.  
> Everything else can be layered on top.
